# AI Coding Agent Instructions for SAS-JS

Welcome to the SAS-JS codebase! This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents to be productive and aligned with the project's conventions. Please follow these instructions carefully when contributing to this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains JavaScript code organized into chapters, each focusing on a specific programming concept. The chapters include:

1. **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**
2. **Functions**
3. **Conditions and Boolean Logic**

Each chapter has its own `index.html` and JavaScript files (`script.js`, `script2.js`), which demonstrate the concepts covered in that chapter.

## Code Organization

- **Folder Structure**: Each chapter is self-contained, with its own HTML and JavaScript files.
- **File Naming**: Files are named descriptively to reflect their purpose (e.g., `script.js` for main logic, `script2.js` for supplementary code).
- **Language**: The codebase is entirely in JavaScript, with HTML files for demonstration purposes.

## Development Guidelines

### General Conventions
- **Code Style**: Follow standard JavaScript conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain non-obvious logic, especially in educational examples.
- **Modularity**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

### Chapter-Specific Patterns
- **Chapter 1**: Focus on variable declarations, data types, and operators. Examples should be simple and illustrative.
- **Chapter 2**: Demonstrate function creation and usage. Include examples of both named and anonymous functions.
- **Chapter 3**: Showcase conditional statements and boolean logic. Use real-world scenarios for examples.

## Key Files

- `ðŸ“˜ Chapter 1 â€“ Variables, Data Types and Operators/script.js`: Examples of variable declarations and operators.
- `ðŸ“˜ Chapitre 2 â€“ Fonctions simples/script.js`: Demonstrates basic function usage.
- `ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3 â€“ Conditions and Boolean Logic/script.js`: Contains examples of conditional logic.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Understand the Context**: Review the relevant chapter to understand its focus and existing examples.
2. **Add Examples**: Ensure new examples align with the chapter's theme and are well-documented.
3. **Test Changes**: Open the corresponding `index.html` file in a browser to verify the examples work as intended.
4. **Commit Changes**: Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Add example of ternary operator in Chapter 3`).

## Notes for AI Agents

- **Be Context-Aware**: Ensure changes align with the educational purpose of the repository.
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Keep examples simple and focused on the concept being taught.
- **Preserve Clarity**: Maintain clear and concise code to aid learning.

For any questions or clarifications, consult the repository owner or contributors.
